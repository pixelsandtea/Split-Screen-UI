Step One: The Four Areas
This currently only supports up to four areas, though it is possible to add more should you wish, though then it'll start getting more and more complicated and so I won't go into that right now. Add each area to the end of your document before the closing </body> tag using the following format:

<div class="area" id="area1">
	<div class="content">
		<!-- AREA1 CONTENT -->
	</div>
</div>
            
<div class="area" id="area2">
	<div class="content">
		<!-- AREA2 CONTENT -->
	</div>
</div>…and so on…
        
Step Two: Leave The Styling Alone
At the moment all four areas will be sitting at the bottom of the page looking like an ordinary section of the page and you should leave that as is for the benefit of the "JavaScript Off" kinda folks.

Step Three: Add The Supporting Files
If you haven't got a '/scripts/' directory immediately below your root level then you should add one and copy the contents of this '/scripts/' directory to yours. And you'll also need the stylesheet.css stored at the root level too.

Step Four: The Nav Menu
Write your navigation menu
